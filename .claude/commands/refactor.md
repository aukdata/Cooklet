# Refactor the codebase

You are responsible for refactoring the codebase to improve readability, modularity, and separation of concerns.
Avoid superficial adjustments â€” your changes should aim for structural clarity and long-term maintainability.
After completing the refactoring, run pnpm run build:netlify to confirm successful compilation.
Then, report the summary to the user in Japanese.
Think harder.

Note: The goal is not only to simplify the code, but also to clarify responsibilities and improve extensibility.

## Phase 1: Identify and Refactor Complex Structures

- Make sure to read the documents before proceeding.
- Run `find ./src -name "*.tsx" -not -path "*/assets/*" | xargs wc -l | sort -nr | head -20` to detect complex structures.
- Identify large or deeply nested functions, components, or classes.
- Split them into smaller, focused units with clearly defined responsibilities.
- Extract logic into reusable functions or modules when appropriate.
- Ensure that each unit adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Phase 2: Improve Naming and Structure

- Rename variables, functions, and types to make their purpose self-evident.
- Group related logic together and reorganize files/modules as needed.
- Remove unused or redundant code.
- Eliminate magic numbers and replace them with named constants.
- Comments in the source code must explain the intent behind the code. Do not include explanations of how the code works or the history of changes.Any change history should be moved to `.claude/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.
- The `any` type is forbidden. Use `unknown` only if a more specific type or its combination is not possible.

## Phase 3: Remove duplications

- Run `similarity-ts src` to detect duplications.
- Unify the duplications if needed.
- If a specification change is needed for unification, notify the user.

## Phase 4: Confirm Behavior and Build

- Ensure that the refactored code maintains the original behavior.
- Run tests if available, or manually verify expected output.
- The build must complete without errors.

Finally, run:

```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm run build:netlify
```

## Phase 5: Complete The Refactor

- Apply the changes to the documents.
- Report the summary of your changes to the user in Japanese.
